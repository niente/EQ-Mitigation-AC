This is a project showing some of the nuances of Mitigation AC in EverQuest.

Mitigation AC was first explained by Dzarn in [this post](https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/ac-vs-acv2.210028/#post-3078126) on the EQ forums.

This equation allows EQ players to determine the effectiveness of different sources of AC - armor, spells, specific AA, and how effective each is for the different classes.

The charts were made in google sheets, using a standard of CotF Teir 1 raid armor, and standard buffs.
